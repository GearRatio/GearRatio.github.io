# The Perfect Team and What Google Learned

This was an interesting article. I immediately began thinking about my own past experiences as it related to working with other in groups. I think my past role was similar to Julia's experiences while at Yale. I never really felt at ease in my last role. My manager, an executive VP, was an easy going person but when we had meetings there were disorganized and often felt like a battle. I think this had to do with the overall group dynamics and how comfortable people felt with one another. There was always tension and at times would cause meetings to run over or end without accomplishing anything at all. Many of my departments team members knew each other outside of work. I, however, kept a low profile. Mainly due to the fact that I felt the need to be guarded. It is hard sharing personal things about yourself. In the past, I had tired that and was mocked. So as a result, I felt it necessary to be on guard moving forward. In moments though, I would try to share things with people in order to not try to allow that feeling to persist within my own team that I was managing. I think, to some extent, I was able to build confidence in them and in what they were capable of. However, my guarded approach always made people feel like I was on edge. Then again, maybe I was!

What I learned from reading this article along with my past experiences is that culture is important. Being able to be part of a group and work well with others is important. However, communication in a group is a two way street. You have to be able to feel comfortable with those you are working with in order to feel at ease and, they in turn, need to be open to helping you achieve that. One or two people can throw that dynamic off for everyone. Addressing that group dynamic, when it is off, is a challenge. Team building exercises help break down some of those barriers but not always.
